# HoliBot
Twilio Text Bot created at Superposition II 2018

Texts you a random national holiday based on the date you text it! For example, if you text HoliBot "February 03", it will reply with "February 03 is Carrot Cake Day!" If you text HoliBot "Today" it will reply with a National Holiday that is celebrated today.

To use this code, clone the repo and run the reply.py Flask app. In order to use the send_hello_text.py file (to send initial hello text to users) you will need to put your own phone number in the to field, as well as put in your own Twilio account_sid and auth_token.
